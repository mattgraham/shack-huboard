Ways to contribute:

  * The easiest way you can contribute by simply using huboard and adding issues. Find bugs or think of cool features, let me know by submitting issues
  * Take a look at the open issues. Anything is fair game, pick one and send me a pull request.
  * I've added a label called `Please contribute`, these are features/defects that are lower priority but would still be a great addition to the product
